# paritizer-media-viewer
Web interface for viewing media files served by the paritizer file-access service

##

Fast setup:

Download `dist/index.html` and open it in any browser. Fill in your settings to connect to a file-access-server and you're ready to go! If you would like to customize the default duration and server, you can copy the `dist/config.example.js` file to `dist/config.js` and fill in your settings there. You can copy and send `index.html` and, optionally, `config.js` to anywhere and load it in any browser and it will work great. `index.html` is sufficient, but if you want the custom config, it just has to be in the same directory as `index.html`.
